# Calendify
Calendify transforms the tedious task of manually entering syllabus dates into a fun and easy experience. Users upload PDFs of their syllabi, and Calendify extracts all the important information. Users are given a preview where they can decide to remove certain events (for those who never attend tutorials...), or edit any details including date and time, location, and even a description (it automatically adds grading weights here if available!). Once satisfied, simply press confirm to download the .ics file that can be uploaded to the calendar app of your choice.

This web app features a dynamic React frontend, and a Flask-powered backend. We used pdfplumber API to extract of each pdf and put the all together, then added constants such as semester start and end dates as well as days off for spring break. Finally, through trial and error we meticulously crafted a tailored query to pass to OpenAI to format in .ics syntax. We parsed through this to display on our user interface for editing purposes, then manually reformatted it to .ics to be downloaded by the user.
